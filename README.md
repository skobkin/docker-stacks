# Docker Compose config collection

## How to set up?

Basically you need to choose which service you want to run and then
create needed `.env` files from `.end.dist` template.

```shell
# Choose a service
cd folding-at-home
# Copy template
cp .env.dist .env
# edit the config to your preference
nano -w .env
# Create and run containers
docker-compose up -d
# Optional: check the logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

Some services may require additional configuration. Check for additional `README.md` files
or comments in the `docker-compose.yml` files or `.env.dist` templates.
